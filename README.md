About Us

At EyePal, we believe in creating a more inclusive world where everyone can fully experience public spaces. Our app bridges the gap between visually impaired individuals and volunteers eager to help, fostering connection and community. By enabling users to navigate large venues like shopping malls together, we aim to promote accessibility and inclusion for all.


Our Vision

Our vision is to build a world where visually impaired individuals feel empowered and supported in every environment. We strive to create seamless, intuitive solutions that enhance independence and foster meaningful human connections. Through EyePal, we envision public spaces becoming more welcoming, accessible, and inclusive for everyone.


How It Works

Using EyePal is simple and intuitive:
	1.	Upon arrival at a large venue, both visually impaired users and volunteers open the app.
	2.	By clicking a main button, the app pairs a visually impaired user with a nearby volunteer.
	3.	Once paired, the app displays their names and phone numbers, enabling easy communication.


EyePal also allows businesses to participate by encouraging staff to volunteer, fostering a more inclusive environment while attracting customers and boosting engagement.


Why We Started

We started EyePal because we believe that everyone deserves to experience public spaces without limitations. Inspired by the need to improve accessibility in large venues, we wanted to create a simple yet powerful tool that connects people and promotes inclusivity. EyePal is more than just an app — it’s a step toward a world where empathy and assistance are always within reach.
